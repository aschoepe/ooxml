    ooxml ECMA-376 Office Open XML File Formats


    This directory contains a freely distributable pure tcl extension called ooxml.


SYSNOPSIS

    Read and Write Office Open XML "XLSX" since Excel 2007

    This package contains several commands to edit Excel files. The three most important
    are the following three:

        Importing Excel files into a Tcl array with ::ooxml::xl_read,
        export Tcl data to an Excel file with ::ooxml::xl_write and
        export Tcl tablelist to an Excel file with ::ooxml::tablelist_to_xl.

    For information on how to use these commands, see the examples and the man-page
    at https://fossil.sowaswie.de/ooxml.
